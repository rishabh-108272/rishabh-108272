# 👋 Hi, I'm Rishabh Verma  

🚀 **AI & ML Engineer | Full-Stack AI Builder | Curious Systems Thinker**

I build **intelligent systems end-to-end** — from **deep learning models** to **production-ready AI platforms**.  
Right now, I’m sharpening my edge by going deeper into **full-stack engineering**, **LLM internals**, and **MLOps**, while still shipping real-world AI solutions.

I consider myself a **Full-Stack AI Engineer** —  
but yeah, still decoding the *true* soul of full-stack engineering 😄

## 🧠 What I Do
- Design & train **ML / DL models** (CV, NLP, XAI)
- Build **AI-powered SaaS platforms**
- Integrate **LLMs into real applications**
- Turn research ideas into **scalable systems**
- Obsess over **clean architecture & explainability**

---

## 🔥 Currently Working On
- 🧩 **Full-Stack Development**
  - Deep diving into **Django, FastAPI, React, Node.js**
  - Understanding backend architecture beyond “just APIs”

- 🧠 **LLMs – from math to production**
  - Trying to reach the **mathematical core of LLMs**
  - Transformers, attention, optimization intuition

- 🔗 **Agentic & LLM Frameworks**
  - Exploring **LangChain** & **LangGraph**
  - Multi-agent workflows & reasoning pipelines

- ⚙️ **MLOps**
  - Model versioning, deployment & monitoring
  - Bridging the gap between notebooks and production
